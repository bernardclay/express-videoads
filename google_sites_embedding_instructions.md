## Additional Tips for Google Sites

### Improving Load Time
- Optimize any additional images you add using Google Sites' built-in image tools
- Keep embedded HTML sections separate rather than combining them

### Maintaining SEO Benefits
- The schema markup in section1_head.html will help search engines understand your content
- All keyword-rich internal links will help with SEO ranking signals
- The semantic HTML structure is preserved for better search engine interpretation

### Updating Content
- To update any section, simply edit the embedded HTML code
- For major changes, consider replacing the entire embedded section

## Important Notes About Google Sites Limitations

1. **JavaScript Limitations**: Google Sites restricts some JavaScript functionality. The simplified countdown script should work, but complex interactions might not.

2. **Form Handling**: Direct form submissions aren't supported in embedded HTML. All CTAs link to your SamCart checkout as a workaround.

3. **Custom Fonts**: Google Sites may not load custom fonts from embedded HTML. The design uses web-safe alternatives as fallbacks.

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: While the embedded HTML includes mobile-responsive design, test thoroughly on mobile devices as Google Sites' container might affect the layout.

5. **Analytics Integration**: For proper analytics tracking, use Google Sites' built-in Google Analytics integration rather than embedded tracking code.

By following these instructions, you'll have your Express VideoAds landing page successfully embedded in Google Sites while preserving all SEO optimizations, internal linking, and design elements.
